# Weeks 1–2 Deliverable: Foundations & Literature Review Summary

DeFi liquidity providers (LPs), especially those using **Uniswap v3 positions** as collateral in lending protocols like Aave or Compound, face frequent liquidations due to **fixed Loan-to-Value (LTV)** models. These static thresholds (typically 65–82% for assets like ETH) fail to account for the unique risks of concentrated liquidity positions, such as rapid **impermanent loss (IL)** when prices move outside chosen ranges.

In contrast, **Traditional Finance (TradFi)** employs **risk-based portfolio margining** (expanded by the SEC in 2006), which stress-tests entire portfolios across multiple price and volatility scenarios (e.g., 10-point shocks of ±6–15%), incorporates full hedging offsets (netting), and adjusts margins dynamically in real-time. This approach recognizes non-linear risks (via valuation points and vega shocks) and allows significantly higher leverage (often 5–10x) for hedged positions while reducing sudden full liquidations through graduated, often automated partial adjustments.

Adopting TradFi-inspired dynamic, IL-aware stress testing in DeFi could dramatically lower liquidation risks, enable safer 80–90% LTV ratios, and unlock greater capital efficiency for LPs.

## Expanded Comparison Table: DeFi Fixed LTV vs. TradFi Portfolio Margin

| Feature                          | DeFi Fixed LTV (e.g., Aave/Compound)                                      | TradFi Portfolio Margin (SEC 2006 Risk-Based)                                      | Implication for Uniswap v3 LPs/Liquidations                              |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Calculation Method               | Fixed percentage threshold (e.g., 65–82% LTV for ETH)                     | Stress-test entire portfolio at 10+ discrete price/volatility points; margin = worst-case net loss | TradFi captures non-linear IL risks better; fewer surprise liquidations  |
| Hedge/Offset Recognition         | Limited or none for complex/concentrated positions                        | Comprehensive risk-based netting across all related positions (correlation offsets) | TradFi rewards hedging/rebalancing, reducing effective risk               |
| Leverage Possible                | Typically 1.2–1.8x (restricted by IL volatility)                           | Often 5–10x+ for diversified/hedged portfolios                                     | TradFi enables "leverage loops" to amplify LP yields without excess risk |
| Adjustment Frequency             | Static until threshold breached                                           | Real-time/intraday recalculation (reacts to price & IV changes)                    | Prevents binary wipeouts; allows proactive adjustments                   |
| Liquidation Trigger & Style      | Binary: Full position liquidated at fixed threshold (e.g., health factor <1) | Graduated: Warnings, partial/auto-rebalancing; rare full wipeouts                  | DeFi sees high frequency; TradFi-style could cut liquidations 95–99%     |
| Risk Sensitivity                 | Low (ignores volatility spikes or non-linearity)                          | High (includes vega/volatility shocks and gamma effects)                           | TradFi protects against "volatility crush" events common in options-like LP positions |
| Procyclicality                   | Lower (fixed rules provide constant buffer)                               | Higher potential (margins rise in volatility spikes, risking feedback loops)       | Trade-off: TradFi efficiency in calm markets vs. stress amplification    |
| Treatment of Non-Linear Risks    | Ignores (treats positions linearly)                                       | Captures via multiple valuation points along price curve                           | Critical for v3 concentrated liquidity (IL accelerates outside ranges)   |
| Cross-Asset Netting              | Minimal                                                           | Full (including cross-margining across futures/ETFs)                               | Could net LP positions against derivatives for near-zero net risk        |
| Capital Efficiency Goal          | Basic overcollateralization                                               | Maximize leverage while maintaining systemic resilience                            | TradFi unlocks billions in idle DeFi liquidity via safer borrowing       |

This table highlights why TradFi's sophisticated risk-based approach could transform DeFi LP borrowing, reducing liquidations while boosting TVL and fees through leveraged, resilient positions.
